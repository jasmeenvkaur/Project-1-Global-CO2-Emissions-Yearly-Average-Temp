Conducted exploratory analysis on CO2 emissions for the United States and globally from various emission sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and others. Merged analysis with data from global daily average temps to compare and contrast possible effects from total emissions on yearly average temperatures. This analysis was limited to years 2000-2020 for the most complete data and exploration. Resources below explain the relevance of carbon emissions to corporations and how it may affect profits.
